# Attack on Titan Tribute Game Generic Logic
Generic logic is Expedition Mod Custom Logic which is made as generic as possible. This allows users to use this logic within every map they desire, and use it as a base for their own custom logic implementations by its extensions.

The expedition mod can be downloaded here: https://discord.gg/UTpXD5Q
This custom logic is daily used within the Expeditions Beyond the Walls Community: https://discord.gg/Xd9sS8J

Please view the Basic.md here for basic instructions how the custom logic works: https://github.com/Lithrun/aottg-generic-logic/blob/master/BASIC.md

Please note, that this logic will no longer work in AoTTG 2. To stay up to date with the sequel, please check out AoTTG 2:

# Acknowledgements
This custom logic was primarily developed by me, Lithrun or as most know me within AoTTG: Erwin Smith. I want to give my special thanks to: Syeo, Potato, Axel and Marazul for their contributions and ideas. Even more special thanks to Tic, as without the Expedition Mod custom logic would have never been able to become this advanced.

# Terms and Conditions
1. Do not alter the credits message. The people worked hard on this logic, and removing their effort is disrespectfull.
2. You're free to modify this logic based on your needs. It is advised however to only modify the OnRoundStart and adding additional commands at the OnChatInput
3. For code improvements and new featuers, please pop a pull request at https://github.com/Lithrun/aottg-generic-logic

# Updates and feature requests
If you notice any issues or want to request a feature, please make use of the tools that Github has available for those. The items that are to be suggested, will have to be applyable in a generic way, as otherwise it is just map specific and doesn't belong inside the generic logic.

If you wish to implement something yourself, make use of pull requests please.

# Installation

To install the Custom Logic within your map, add the "generic logic.cs" to the Custom Logic section with the EM's
